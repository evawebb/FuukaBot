There should be three global variables set in your `secrets.rb` file:

* `TOKEN` is the token for your app bot user. It can be accessed under "My Apps" in the Discord Developer pages.
* `ID` is the client ID for your app. It is accessed in the same place.
* `WEATHER_API_KEY` is an OpenWeatherMap API key. You can easily get one for free by making an account at https://openweathermap.org.
